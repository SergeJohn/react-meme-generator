# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


![Here's a description of your meme generator app using React:

Welcome to our meme generator app! With this app, you can easily create your own memes by choosing a template image and adding your own text. We've included a wide selection of popular meme templates to choose from, or you can upload your own image to create a unique meme.

Our app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allows us to create a fast and responsive app that's easy to use.

To get started, simply select a template image and add your own text to create your own personalized meme. You can save your meme to your device or share it with your friends on social media.

Thank you for using our meme generator app! We hope you have fun creating memes and sharing them with your friends.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109452068/209362928-a34d203d-f2ec-434a-8aae-bbf4c56af1df.png)
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
